# Instance Variables Code-Along

## Learning Goals

- Define instance variables
- Distinguish instance variables from local variables
- Describe how instance variables give objects attributes and properties

## Introduction

When we build objects through our own classes, we know we can add **behavior**
to the objects through instance methods. But how do we give our objects
**data**? For example, how would we teach a dog what its name is? Or what breed
it is? How do we put **data** inside of an instance of an object so that each
dog can have its own name and own breed? In other words, how do we give objects
attributes or properties?

## Instructions

Fork and clone this code-along, then run your tests with `bin/rspec` to get an
overview of what we are trying to do. Follow along to get the tests to pass.

## What Is a Local Variable?

We've been working with variables for a while now. For example:

```rb
what_time_is_it = "Lab time"
```

The code above sets a variable, `what_time_is_it`, equal to the string
`"Lab time"`. Now we can use that variable to read and operate on that string.

```rb
what_time_is_it #=> "Lab time"

what_time_is_it.upcase #=> "LAB TIME"
```

The `what_time_is_it` variable is what's known as a **local variable**, so named
because it can only be accessed in a specific, local environment.

A local variable that is defined inside one method **cannot be accessed by
another method**:

```rb
def method_a
  my_local_variable = "I can only be used in method_a"
  puts my_local_variable
end

def method_b
  puts my_local_variable
end

method_b
# NameError (undefined local variable or method `my_local_variable' for main:Object)
```

The **scope** of a local variable is that it is only available within the
method.

In order to get around this limitation, we can use **instance variables** inside
our Ruby classes.

An **instance variable** is a variable that is accessible in any instance method
in a particular instance of a class.

## Local Variables in Instance Methods

Let's say we have a class called `Dog` that is responsible for producing
individual dog objects. We want each dog instance to be able to have a name and
to show its name. So we need to write two methods: one to _set_ the dog's name
and one to _get_ the dog's name.

Open `dog.rb` inside the `lib` folder and add the following two methods to the
`Dog` class:

```rb
class Dog
  def name=(dog_name)
    this_dogs_name = dog_name
  end

  def name
    this_dogs_name
  end
end
```

Here we've defined two **instance methods**, the `#name=` (or "name equals")
method, and the `#name` method. The first method takes in an argument of a dog's
name and assigns that value to a variable, `this_dogs_name`. The second method
is responsible for reporting the name. Our two methods therefore are responsible
for "setting" and "getting" an individual dog's name.

We want the methods to act as mechanisms to expose data from inside of the
object to the outside world; in other words, we want to be able to do this:

```rb
lassie = Dog.new
lassie.name = "Lassie"

lassie.name #=> "Lassie"
```

In the code above, we are creating a new `Dog` instance and assigning it a name
then asking it to return its name.

In your `dog.rb` file add the above code. Run `bin/rspec` again. You should see
output that includes something like this:

```console
bin/rspec
Failure/Error: this_dogs_name

NameError:
  undefined local variable or method `this_dogs_name' for #<Dog:0x00007fa7909a3078>
```

Uh-oh. Looks like the `#name` method doesn't know about the `this_dogs_name`
variable from the `#name=` method. That is because `this_dogs_name` is a **local
variable**. A local variable has a **local scope**, which means that it cannot be
accessed outside of the method in which it is defined.

To solve this problem, we'll need a new kind of variable: an **instance
variable**.

## Implementing Instance Variables

We define an instance variable by prefacing the variable name with an `@`
symbol.

Instance variables are **bound to an instance** of a class. That means that when
we set the value of an attribute on an instance of a class, the value we set is
associated with that particular instance. This makes intuitive sense: a dog's
name belongs to that specific dog, not to `Dog`s in general.

Instance variables hold information about an instance, i.e., they describe
_attributes_ or _properties_ of the instance, such as its name or breed. They
can be called on throughout the class, without needing to be passed into other
methods as arguments (as would be the case with local variables).

Let's refactor our `Dog` class to use an **instance variable** instead of a
local variable to set and get an individual dog's name.

Inside `dog.rb`, change the `Dog` class in the following way:

```rb
class Dog

  def name=(dogs_name)
    @this_dogs_name = dogs_name
  end

  def name
    @this_dogs_name
  end
end

lassie = Dog.new
lassie.name = "Lassie"

puts lassie.name

```

Run `bin/rspec` again; your tests should now be passing. By changing the local
variable `this_dogs_name` to an instance variable `@this_dogs_name`, we've
effectively changed its **scope**: instead of only being available to the method
it's defined in, it's now available to **all instance methods** defined within
the class.

## Defining Getter and Setter Methods

In Object-Oriented Ruby, we want to be able to **set attributes** on the
instances of our classes. To do this, we create _setter_ methods, which take an
argument and set the **instance variable** equal to that value:

```rb
class Dog
  # setter method
  def name=(value)
    # assign the @name instance variable a value of whatever is passed as an argument
    @name = value
  end
end

odie = Dog.new

# call the Dog#name= method with a value of "Odie"
odie.name = "Odie"
# this is equivalent to calling odie.name=("Odie")
```

We also want those objects to "know" the values of their attributes. So we also
create a _getter_ method that will return the value of the instance variable:

```rb
class Dog
  # setter method
  def name=(value)
    @name = value
  end

  # getter method
  def name
    # access the data from the @name instance variable and return it
    @name
  end
end

odie = Dog.new
odie.name = "Odie"

# call the Dog#name method
puts odie.name
# "Odie"
```

By using the `@` in front of the variable name, the variable that's created
inside the _setter_ method is available inside the _getter_ method (and inside
any other methods in our class).

Note that this is quite different from the way we assign attributes to objects
in JavaScript, which doesn't require instance variables or getter/setter
methods:

```js
class Dog {}

const odie = new Dog();
odie.name = "Odie";
console.log(odie.name);
// "Odie"
```

Remember, unlike JavaScript, whenever we use **dot notation** in Ruby, we're
calling a **method** on an **object**.

## Conclusion

As we dive deeper into object-oriented Ruby, we'll be using **instance
variables** frequently to pass information around the **instance methods** of a
class.

Think of instance variables as the containers for instance-specific information.
If we define objects as the combination of **data** and **behavior**, then
instance variables are where we store the data, and instance methods define the
behavior.

The ability of instance variables to store information and be accessible within
different instance methods is one of the things that makes it possible for us to
create similar but unique objects in object-oriented Ruby.
